# NUDE - MOS

NUDE - MOS is the MacOS version of NUDE. The program is created in Python and is still not fully tested.

## Installation

To install the MacOS version of NUDE download the .command file and use the following command in terminal.

```
chmod u+x /path/to/nude.command
```

Then just start the *nude.command* file in Finder.

## Example

1. After starting the program user enters: *"/path/to/json/package.json"*.
2. On the sencond prompt the user enters: *"Y"*.
3. Your packages are updated (hopefully)

## Issues

- The program is only tested on my own computer, e.g. I'm not fully aware of what needs to be downloaded in order for it to work.

- All of the functionallity of the original NUDE might not be included in this version.

- When typing in the command-prompt of the program the input need to be inbetween quotes e.g. *"path/to/file"*.
